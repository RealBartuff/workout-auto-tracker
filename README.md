<br />
Workout Auto Tracker is a project I created as a final exam for "Python Developer" bootcamp which I participated in. It is an app that uses OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries for estimating your position and tracking your body movement. Based on that the app can recognize what kind of exercise you perform, count reps and store them in a databse. Whole layout is made in Kivy.<br />
Although it is still work in progress you can download and run it. It works :)<br />
Things yet to apply I'm currently working on:
- more exercises recognition (right now it's pushups and squats)
- easy access from UI to all data stored in data base
- more accurate pose estimation
